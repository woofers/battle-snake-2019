* Battle Snake 2019

@@html:<img height="120" width="120" src="screenshots/advanced.png" />@@

A simple [[https://www.battlesnake.io][BattleSnake]] written in Java.

Was entered in the expert divison of 2019's tournament as **🐍 ‏‏‎ 𝙎𝙐𝙋𝙀𝙍 𝙎𝙇𝙄𝙈𝙀𝙔 ‏‏‎ 🐍**.

Deployed to [[https://battlesnake-liquid.herokuapp.com/][https://battlesnake-liquid.herokuapp.com/]]

** Strategy

Our snake's strategy was aggresive. For each turn, if the snake wasn't
the largest on the board, or if the health was below a specific
threshold, the snake would navigate towards the closest food. Otherwise,
it would try to target the other snakes' heads to either eliminate the
opponent in a head-on collision or trap them by cutting off their path.

*** Drawbacks

Despite efforts to improve the issue from 2018's entry, the snake's biggest
drawback was trapping itself in its own tail. Wedidn't implement an effective
algorithm to calculate dangerous regions of the board, and ultimately the
snake died by going for a food point and boxing itself in.
